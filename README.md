# the War Games Construction Kit

An ancient shareware game anno 2001.

Very old and bad code mostly, mixture of C and C++, my first forray into the world of games programming.
The game was very popular between 2001 and 2003 or so, and got around 500,000 downloads as shareware.

C++, OpenGL and Win32.  It is old by any standard and was ok for shareware at the time.

However, take it for what it is.
